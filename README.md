StickIt is an online sticky note tracker that users can use and interact with to manage their tasks. Our goal is to provide an online interface that simulates sticky notes to provide a better user experience. The main functionalities of StickIt are creating, editing, and deleting stickies and boards. Compared to existing sticky note applications, StickIt allows the users to organize and customize the sticky notes and boards to their preference.
